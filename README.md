# cmssw-xrootd-utils
Just scripts to look into xrootd versions per cmssw release and scram architecture.

Note: Releases V4_XX or below used a different XRootD control version, so versions like 5.28.00 should not be considered.

CMSSW 9.x or below are not token ready.
CMSSW 14.x and above are all token ready.
